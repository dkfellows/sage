<A NAME="What Is It"></A>What Is It</H2>
Sage is a run-time code analyzer for your Tcl and Tk applications, also
know as a profiler. When you run your programs with Sage, you can collect
and view this type of data:
<OL>
<LI>
total execution time of program</LI>

<LI>
total time spent in global scope</LI>

<LI>
total time spent in each procedure</LI>

<LI>
total time spent in each procedure and its descendants</LI>

<LI>
number of times each procedure is called</LI>
</OL>
Time data can be displayed in 3 formats:
<OL>
<LI>
clicks (output from <TT>clock clicks</TT>)</LI>

<LI>
seconds</LI>

<LI>
a percentage of the total time</LI>
</OL>
This information is useful in pinpointing performance bottlenecks in your
programs, and it provides a reference for selectively optimizing your code.

<P>To look at the user's guide, <A HREF="USERS.html">CLICK&nbsp;HERE</A>.

<P>Sage should work on any Tcl/Tk 8.0 or greater platform, although it
has only been tested on Linux i386 and SunOS/Solaris.

<A NAME="Screenshots"></A>Screenshots</H2>
Sage consists of two tools: the <B>sage</B> tool for running your application
and collecting data, and the <B>sageview</B> tool for viewing the data.
The following screenshots are from the <B>sageview</B> tool.
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
This is displaying data from the default configuration; showing proc times,
as a percentage of the total time, with 2 decimal places: <A HREF="images/default.gif">SCREEN</A>.</LI>

<LI>
This displays proc times + its descendants: <A HREF="images/descend.gif">SCREEN</A>.</LI>

<LI>
This displays proc times + its descendants in seconds: <A HREF="images/descsecs.gif">SCREEN</A>.</LI>

<LI>
This displays number of times each proc was called: <A HREF="images/calls.gif">SCREEN</A>.</LI>

<A NAME="Future Versions"></A>Future Versions</H2>
Here are some features to come in future versions:
<UL>
<LI>
Windows support</LI>

<LI>
Option to selectively wrap commands (as opposed to procs) for data collection.&nbsp;
This means you will be able to profile C-compiled Tcl commands as well
as Tcl/Tk commands like <TT>lindex</TT> or <TT>update</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
Create a new scope called .bind., which contains the time data for statements
run as bind callbacks.</LI>

<LI>
Speed up data collection procs via C commands.</LI>

<LI>
Ability to wrap Tk widgets as they are created in order to gather data
on widget commands.</LI>

<LI>
Spruce up print dialog and support prettier PS output.</LI>

<LI>
Improve interface to filters</LI>

<LI>
Run program in its own interpreter.</LI>

<LI>
A GUI for sage to better specify what data you want collected.</LI>

<LI>
Statement performance breakdowns: collect data on a statement by statement
basis, instead of proc by proc. Perhaps this will be selective by proc;
otherwise it might be too slow to do statement analysis for entire program.
For instance, user can select to do statement analysis for the procs x,
y, and z.</LI>

<LI>
Proc details. For each proc, keep track of the following data:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
who called me and how many times</LI>

<LI>
who do I call, how many times, and how much time do I spend in each descendant</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Call graph? Is this sort of thing useful?</LI>

<LI>
Test coverage support?</LI>
</UL>
