This is the announcement for the first public release of Sage, version 1.0.

What Is Sage?

Sage is a run-time code analyzer for your Tcl and Tk applications, also
know as a profiler. When you run your programs with Sage, you can collect
and view this type of data:

   1. total execution time of program
   2. total time spent in global scope
   3. total time spent in each procedure
   4. total time spent in each procedure and its descendants
   5. number of times each procedure is called

Time data can be displayed in 3 formats: 

   1. clicks (output from clock clicks)
   2. seconds
   3. a percentage of the total time

This information is useful in pinpointing performance bottlenecks in your
programs, and it provides a reference for selectively optimizing your code.

Sage is written in 100% Tcl/Tk and should work on any Tcl/Tk 8.0 or greater
platform, although it has only been tested on Linux i386 and SunOS/Solaris.

Here you will find the distribution tar file, much more detailed
documentation, and screenshots.
